# Horizon status

How close Horizon is to vanilla 26.3: the player-visible gaps the port ledger found, and what the differential harnesses compare. Performance numbers are in the [benchmark guide](benchmark.md).

## Project status

**Player-visible gaps: 0 open** of the 833 the [port ledger](../tools/port_ledger.py) found, reading every vanilla 26.3 method against Horizon's code: vanilla behaviour a player would notice that Horizon doesn't have yet. By area: Animals [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3512); Monsters and bosses [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3513); Entities, projectiles, vehicles and decorations [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3514); Items, enchantments and inventories [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3515); Blocks, redstone and fluids [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3516); World, world generation and saves [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3517); Screens, HUD and client packets [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3518); Entity and block rendering, models [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3519); Server and players on the server [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3520); Mob AI, villagers and raids [0](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/issues/3521). This number goes down as gaps close (`tools/parity_gaps.py`); the table below says what the harnesses compare.

The table is the project's own audit of what the harnesses compare, subsystem by subsystem: a score says how much of that subsystem the harnesses cover and pass, not that nothing else differs from vanilla. What players still run into: [known issues](known-issues.md).

### What the harnesses compare

Scores: 0 (absent), 0.25 (started), 0.5 (playable, major features missing), 0.75 (mostly complete) or 1 (its harnesses cover the subsystem and pass). Last audited 2026-10-13: the harnesses pass on Linux and macOS. The [port ledger](../tools/port_ledger.py) adds a method-by-method view of what is ported.

| Subsystem | Score | Main gaps |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Window, input and game loop | 1 | None: game loop, options, camera, auto-jump, toggle sprint/sneak and frame limiter match |
| Assets and resources | 1 | None: item models match over 196,290 stacks; the resource pack screen over 3,000 sessions |
| Network protocol and multiplayer | 1 | None: joins vanilla servers; the dedicated server matches vanilla's files, login, configuration, play and command tree; LAN discovery over 462 cases (offline mode only) |
| Chunk storage and palettes | 1 | None: client and saves share paletted containers, identical to vanilla over 266 scenarios |
| Section meshing | 1 | None: 112 scenes and over a million quads identical to vanilla |
| Rendering | 1 | None: entity models, block entity renderers (407 cases) and animations (296), HUD overlays (2,200 states), the recipe book (600), player list, subtitles and world border match |
| Lighting | 1 | None: saved and relit light matches vanilla, slabs and stairs included |
| World generation | 1 | None: 2,352 whole chunks over 225 structure sites, in all three dimensions, identical to vanilla |
| Region files and saves | 1 | None: saves round-trip with vanilla; worlds from 1.8 to 26.2 upgrade as vanilla's DataFixers do |
| Entities and physics | 1 | None: attributes, spawn rules, natural spawning (15,500 cases), raids and patrols (1,900), `finalizeSpawn` (24,000) and mob AI (92 scenarios) match |
| Interaction and inventory | 1 | None: menu clicks over 8,000 sequences; recipe book placement (6,000), buttons (1,200), saved book (1,500), loom and crafter screens (1,600) |
| Menus, HUD and chat | 1 | None: every command (758 over 39,685 inputs), scoreboards (81,000 operations), the player list (872,000 draw calls), chat and its suggestions (3,000 sessions) match |
| Audio | 1 | None: the sound engine, sound events, music, situational music, ambience and subtitles match vanilla |
| Block behaviours and ticking | 1 | None: block updates, random ticks, redstone, dispensers (6,000 cases), crafters (4,000), container spills (4,000), copper golems and the sculk family (435 scenarios) match |
